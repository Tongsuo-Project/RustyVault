In order to clarify the rights granted with Contributions from any person or entity, the Project must have a Contributor License Agreement (the “Agreement” or “CLA”) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This Agreement is for Your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of the Project and its users; it does not change Your rights to use Your own Contributions for any other purpose.<br />为明确由任何实体就“贡献”授予的知识产权许可，本项目的每个贡献者须签署一份《贡献者许可协议》（“本协议”或“CLA”）并交由基金会存档，表明其同意如下许可条款。本协议将贵方作为贡献者进行保护，且同时也保护本项目及其用户；但不会改变贵方为其他目的使用贵方所拥有的“贡献”的权利。

This version of the Agreement allows an individual to submit Contributions to the Project, and to grant copyright and patent licenses to the Foundation.<br />本版本的本协议允许个人向本项目提交“贡献”，并向基金会授予著作权和专利许可。

Please read this CLA carefully before completing and signing it, and keep a copy for Your records.<br />请在填写和签署本协议之前请仔细阅读本协议内容，并保留一份CLA副本作为贵方的记录。

The rights that You grant to us under these terms are effective on the date You first submitted a Contribution to this Project, even if Your submission took place before the date You agreed to these terms and conditions. Except for the license granted herein to the Project and recipients of the Work distributed by the Project, You reserve all rights, title and interest in and to Your Contributions.<br />贵方根据这些条款授予我们的权利自贵方首次向本项目提交“贡献”之日起生效，即使贵方的提交是在贵方同意这些条款和条件之前进行的。除本协议授予本项目和本项目所分发“本作品”的接收者的许可外，贵方保留对您的“贡献”中的所有权利、产权和利益。
