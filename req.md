# Motivation

HashiCorp Vault is the most widely used secret management product in cloud native realm. But in practice, it has some disadvantages:

1. Open-source license is not OSI-approved any more;
2. Lack of cryptography compliance ability except FIPS, including:
  * cryptography algorithms
  * cryptography validations in other countries and regions
3. Inadequate cryptography performance especially in  critical scenarios;
4. Many useful features are not open-sourced
5. ...

And compared to Hashicorp Vault, there is rare open source key/secret management project available in the market. Thus, we started a new open source project to address the issues.

The new project needs to fulfill most features the a traditional KMS has. It also needs to be a replacement for Hashicorp Vault, with the features that even are not included in the open source versions of Vault. As such, the new project should be:

0. Written in Rust to achieve memory safe
0. Fully compatible with Hashicorp Vault on APIs and data format
1. Configurable underlying cryptograhpic module
2. High performance on cryptography operations
3. High availability
4. Support for underlying cryptography hardware
5. OSI-approved open-source license
