//! This crate is the 'library' part of RustyVault, a Rust and real free replica of Hashicorp Vault.
//! RustyVault is focused on identity-based secrets management and works in two ways independently:
//!
//! 1. A standalone application serving secrets management via RESTful API;
//! 2. A Rust crate that provides same features for other application to integrate.
//!
//! This document is only about the crate part of RustyVault. For the first working mode,
//! please go to RustyVault's [RESTful API documentation], which documents all RustyVault's RESTful API.
//! Users can use an HTTP client tool (curl, e.g.) to send commands to a running RustyVault server and
//! then have relevant secret management features.
//!
//! The second working mode, which works as a typical Rust crate called `rusty_vault`, allows Rust
//! application developers to integrate RustyVault easily into their own applications to have the
//! ability of secrets management such as secure key/vaule storage, public key cryptography, data
//! encryption and so forth.
//!
//! This is the official documentation of crate `rusty_vault`, and it's mainly for developers.
//! Once again, if you are looking for how to use the RustyVault server via a set of RESTful API,
//! then you may prefer the RustyVault's [RESTful API documentation].
